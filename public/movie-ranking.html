<h1>The Best Movies According to Brandon</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Toy Story</h3> 
<p>This movie is very nostalgic for me and Pixar just does really well with all the characters and storylines.</p>
<h3>Dune 2</h3> 
<p>Although it is 3 hours long, this movie was set up perfectly and is filled with great storywriting, action, and drama. One of the better recent sci-fi films to date.</p> 
<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3> 
<p>Another 2+ hour movie but this movie packs an amazing story filled with laughter, action, and tears as it tells a heart warming story through multiversal adeventures. </p>
